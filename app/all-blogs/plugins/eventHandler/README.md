eventHandler
============

eventHandler is a dotclear plugin to manage events (meetings, shows,...) on your blog.

The main developement has been made by Jc Denis <contact@jcdenis.fr> - http://jcd.lv.
Many thanks to him for that great plugin. I will try to maintain that plugin so that it can be used in recent dotclear releases.

Requirements
------------

Of course, that plugin needs a dotclear blog engine.
