dotSlick makes image galleries easy

* widget in post & page editor (you can extend to other post_types at your own risks)
* drang 'n' drop gallery creation, insertion of full folders or single images
* fully configurable galleries (autoplay, speed, arrows, dots & mousewheel navigation


WARNING : weird results with shorten content in templates. no workaround at the moment,
except not using {{tpl:EntryContent encode_html="1" remove_html="1" cut_string="300"}} in your templates.
